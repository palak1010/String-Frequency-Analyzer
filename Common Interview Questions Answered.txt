Questions about character occurrences in a string can cover a wide range of topics, from basic frequency counts to more complex pattern recognition and transformations. Here are several types of questions that can be derived from character occurrences in a string:

### Basic Frequency Questions

1. _Frequency Count_:
   - How many times does each character appear in the string "example"?
2. _Most Frequent Character_:

   - What is the most frequent character in the string "example"?

3. _Least Frequent Character_:

   - What is the least frequent character in the string "example"?

4. _Unique Characters_:

   - How many unique characters are in the string "example"?

5. _Character with Given Frequency_:
   - Which characters appear exactly twice in the string "example"?

### Specific Character Questions

1. _First Occurrence_:

   - Where is the first occurrence of the character 'e' in the string "example"?

2. _Last Occurrence_:

   - Where is the last occurrence of the character 'e' in the string "example"?

3. _Character Positions_:
   - At which positions does the character 'e' appear in the string "example"?

### Case Sensitivity Questions

1. _Case-Insensitive Frequency Count_:

   - How many times does each character (case-insensitive) appear in the string "Example"?

2. _Case-Sensitive Frequency Count_:
   - How many times does each character (case-sensitive) appear in the string "Example"?

### Substring and Pattern Questions

1. _Most Frequent Substring_:

   - What is the most frequent substring of length 2 in the string "example"?

2. _Palindrome Substrings_:
   - How many palindromic substrings are in the string "example"?

### Transformation Questions

1. _Character Replacement_:

   - If you replace every 'e' with 'a', what is the new string?

2. _Remove Characters_:

   - If you remove all occurrences of 'e', what is the new string?

3. _Character Swap_:

   - If you swap every 'e' with 'x' and vice versa, what is the new string?

### Complex Analytical Questions

1. _Anagram Check_:

   - Are the strings "example" and "pexmale" anagrams of each other?
